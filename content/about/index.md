## About me
Hi there! My name is Raf Van Baelen. I am an independant 🦸‍♂️ software architect from 🌍 Belgium.
I have over 20 years of experience working in the tech industry. I am currently working freelance for my own 💼 company Cyber Tree Consulting. Previously I worked on projects across different domains at [Cegeka](https://www.cegeka.com).

Most of my work is done in the 🕸 web with a focus on agile software development using TDD, Scrum, XP, DDD, ...
My primary language is and has always been [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com). Currently most of my front-end work is done in [Angular](https://angular.io).

In my spare time I 🧪 experiment with other languages, frameworks and some 🎮 [game development]({{< ref "/games" >}}).

But most of my spare time goes to my 👩 wife and three lovely 👨‍👩‍👧 kids.
I also like 👟 running, 📘 reading and playing 🎸 guitar.
